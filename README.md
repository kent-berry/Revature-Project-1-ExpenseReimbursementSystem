# Expense Reimbursement System

## Project Description

The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) will manage the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. All employees in the company can log in and submit requests for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. Finance managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in the company. Finance managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursement.

## Features
With OnIt, a user can:

* Register for an account.
* Sign in to a user home page displaying a filterable (by category, by whether it has been completed) grid list of their tasks.
* Create and edit a task with a name, description, due date, category label, (optional) location via Google Maps and can (optionally) be marked as repeatable. 
  Each task also has an option to send an email reminder to the user one day before its due date.
* View their "Task Stats", where a curve graph shows them how many tasks they've completed over the past n days, where they specify n via a dropdown box.
* Download their task list to a file.
* Update their account information, or delete their account.

To-do's:
* Allow users to specify their own category label for a task instead of (only) offering a set list of choices,
* Show additional data related to user productivity on the "Task Stats" page.
* Send email to a user when they register.
